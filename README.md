# login-page
I have created a sleek and user-friendly login page using HTML CSS JS. The login page features a clean design with a central login form. 
Users can enter their gmail and password to access their accounts. Additionally, there is a "Forgot Password" link for password recovery.
for remember gmail there is remember buttom too.

For new members, I've designed a separate signup page that is easily accessible through a "register" button on the login page.
The signup page allows users to create a new account by providing their personal information, such as name, email, and password. 
It also includes validation checks for password strength. 

Both pages are responsive and visually appealing, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
